# Fix-the-Internet
Recently the question was posed "What's broken about the internet?" The general response from the tech community is that the current internet/web/tech is broken in fundamentally significant ways.  (Ads, search, social media, email, browsing, content, monopoly, privacy, laws, centralization, trolls/spam/phishing, distraction.) This leads to a natural question.  What can be done to fix the problem?  What organizations, projects, technologies, ideas or applications do you see are making an internet that is something we all love, feel safe using and is productive?  What can we do to fix the internet?

## DESCRIPTIONS

### People like to use the internet in ways that are unhealthy
**Problem:** People like to use social media in ways that are unhealthy.  Without a fundamental shift government intervention or other mitigation may do little toward the negative impact modern social media is having on society.

**Solutions:** Let us provide social tools that promote healthy use and germinate the idea that there is a problem with the way we're using tech and encourage the public to work toward healthier technological choices.

### Usefulness
**Problem:** Much of modern tech seems to be "Candy-bar Technology" .. we like it, but at best it doesn't really do much to help in life, and at worst it might actually be bad for us.

**Solutions:** Let us focus on building highly efficient tech: tech that has a low cognitive/maintenance cost with high life improvement value.
